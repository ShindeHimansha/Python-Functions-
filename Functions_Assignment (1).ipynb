        "- Memory Efficiency:\n",
        "    - Generators produce items one at a time and do not store the entire result in memory.\n",

        "    - Generators compute values only when requested (on-the-fly), which can lead to significant performance improvements for large or infinite data sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Infinite Sequences:\n",
        "    - Generators can handle infinite sequences without running out of memory, as they yield values one at a time.\n",
